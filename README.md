# HardcoreController
A plugin I program, cause me and my friends wanted to play Minecraft Hardcore but we thought it would ruin the fun if one of us died early and could not play anymore.
So I added a live and revive system, with customisable revive items.
It was intented to be a private project but I think others might find it useful as well so I started making it more userfriendly.
# To Do
- add more manage options (mob spawn rate etc.)
- maybe replace armorstandgraves with npcs
